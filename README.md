# Project-Two-Bitcoin-Covid-Timeseries-Comparison

This project was started in July 2022 with my mentor Adrian Brudaru's suggestion; everything was done from scratch.

The basic idea was to get daily Bitcoin Prices via an API and ingest them into a database. The second step would be to 
use the Google Public Covid dataset and get the Daily number of Covid cases in some countries and find out if a correlation between the two exists or not.
